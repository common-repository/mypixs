MyPixs is a simple, yet powerful JavaScript and PHP application that gives you the possibility
to display a lot of photos on your blog.

== Description ==

UPDATE : Version 0.3 features a *new, improved close button*, and the ability to *import photosets from Flickr* (!).

New features I'm working on :

*Picasa integration

DESCRIPTION :
MyPixs is a simple, yet powerful JavaScript and PHP application that gives you the possibility
to display a lot of photos on your blog, without them taking up a lot of space.

Your visitors will get to see a small thumbnail (90x90) of the first photo in your set, and can open it by clicking on it.
Then, they can pick a photo they want to see, and it will open in the same window as your blog. (Kinda like Lightbox)

== Installation ==

Installing MyPixs is really simple :

1. UnZip the downloaded folder, and upload the contents to your plugins directory (except the readme.txt file of course).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in wordpress

If you're updating from version 0.2.1 :

1. UnZip the downloaded folder
2. Delete the old MyPixs files from your plugin directory
3. Upload the contents of the UnZipped folder
4. Re-activate the MyPixs plugin in the 'Plugins' menu if necessary
